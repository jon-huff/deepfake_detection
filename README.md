# Deepfake Detection

**University of Chicago Master of Science in Analytics Winter 2021 Capstone** \
 \
This web dashboard processes videos using a custom pipeline to analyze sequences of video frames for deepfake media.  The model powering the detection consists of two image classifiers ensembled with a meta-learner which then passes embedding vectors into an LSTM model for real/fake classification.  Additionally, predicted probabilities and GradCAM vizualizations are offered to the user for model interpretability.
